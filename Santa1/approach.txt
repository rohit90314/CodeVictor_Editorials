Try dry running the problem for N=2,3,4 You will notice some pattern. Let's start with N=2 Case 1 : Suppose santa give n=1 gift to House no1 then gift n=2 will automatically go to House No. 2 --> Favourable Case Case 2 : Suppose santa give n=1 gift to House no2 then gift n=2 will automatically go to House no 1 -->Not Favourable Case: probability = 1/2 = 0.5

Let's start with N=3 Case 1 : Suppose santa give n=1 gift to House no1 then gift n=2 will automatically go to House No. 2 and similarly gift no 3 will go to House no 3 --> Favourable Case Case 2a : Suppose santa give n=1 gift to House no2 then gift n=2 will have choice to go to House no 1 and 3. Lets suppose it chooses House no. 1 Then gift no3 will go to House no 3 -->Favourable Case: Case 2a : Suppose santa give n=1 gift to House no2 then gift n=2 will have choice to go to House no 1 and 3. Lets suppose it chooses House no. 3 Then gift no3 will go to House no 1 -->Not - Favourable Case: Case 3 : Suppose santa gives n=1 gift to House no3 then House 3 cannot get the required gift. ->Not favourable case. Probability = 2/4 = 0.5

So when you will try to do same thing for other cases you will notice that the value of n is just for confusing it always comes to a constant. that is 0.5
