Python sure does get AC for this problem effortlessly.

This editorial goes through a C++ solution.

Observation 1: the number may have 10000 digits and definitely wouldn't fit in a 32 or 64 integer.

Solution: use string to store the number.

Store the sum of digits at odd places, and even places separately. The answer is "YES" if (even+odd)%3==0 and (even-odd)%11==0

IMPORTANT: DO NOT FORGET TO SKIP MINUS SIGN IN CASE OF NEGATIVE NUMBERS This was the only reason why C++ solutions failed.
