DNA sequence of a virus is represented as a string of alphabets (all lower case).

Viruses named covid-16 and covid-17 merge to form covid-18 such that

dna sequence of covid-16 is subsequence of covid-18
dna sequence of covid-17 is also a subsequence of covid-18
Covid-18 then evolves into covid-19, such that

covid-19 has the shortest possible dna sequence that satisfies conditions 1 and 2.
Given dna sequences of covid-16 and covid-17, find the length of dna sequence of covid-19

Input Format

single line containing two space separated strings

(representing dna sequences of covid-16 and covid-17 respectively)

Constraints

0<=dna_sequence_length<=5000

Output Format

single integer

(length of dna sequence of covid-19)

Sample Input 0

abcd cdba
Sample Output 0

6
Explanation 0

DNA sequence for covid-18:"abcdba" or "abcdcdba" or "cdbaabcd", etc

DNA sequence for covid-19 will be "abcdba", the shortest one.
